This is a simple website for myself and my work.

Hello.

I'm Sriniketh, a student at IIT Madras. I love learning and figuring things out. I enjoy solving problems using math and logic. I often find happiness in understanding why things work the way they do.

Outside academics, I like listening to music and writing my thoughts down. I love reading fiction - I feel it helps me build empathy and get a good perspective on things. I also read for the fun of it. I am also a cricket enthusiast and also play the violin, both of which have taught me discipline and teamwork. In short, I like many things and they have taught me many things and I hope to learn even more things.

Thank you for taking the time to read till here.
